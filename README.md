# CSGo-In-game-Bomb-Timer
This is a java made overlay for CSGO that displays the bomb timer.

To download either build in eclipse or download for releases(when ready).

It genarates a Jframe thats the size of a 1080p monitor and cant be clicked and is trasparent. A JLable sits on top of it with the bomb timer(after the bomb is planted)
Thanks to https://github.com/LangdalP/GoTimer for the insperation.

TODO: support non 1080p monitors
