This is a java made overlay for CSGO that displays the bomb timer.

To download either build in eclipse or download for releases(when ready).

How to install:
0.5. make sure java is installed
1. place the config (config/gamestate_intergration_CSGOTimer.cfg) in your csgo config directory(typicly %path to steam%\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg.
2. Run the JAR this should only show a java icon in the task bar at the min.
3. get in game and plant the bomb :)

It genarates a Jframe thats the size of a 1080p monitor and cant be clicked and is trasparent. A JLable sits on top of it with the bomb timer(after the bomb is planted)
